# Quantum Teleportation

This repository contains a Python implementation of quantum teleportation, a technique for transmitting quantum states between distant locations using entanglement.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation of quantum teleportation, you will need to have Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
qiskit
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy qiskit
Once you have the required dependencies installed, you can run the teleport.py script to perform quantum teleportation:

bash
Copy code
python teleport.py
The script will generate a random 1-qubit state, and then use quantum teleportation to transmit the state to a distant location. The final state of the qubit will be printed to the console.

Implementation Details

The teleport.py script implements quantum teleportation using the following steps:

Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits.
Alice prepares the qubit to be teleported in a superposition of the |0> and |1> states.
Alice performs a Bell measurement on the qubit to be teleported and her half of the entangled pair.
Alice sends the two classical bits corresponding to the outcome of the Bell measurement to Bob.
Based on the outcome of the Bell measurement, Bob applies one of four possible quantum operations to his half of the entangled pair.
Bob's qubit is now in the same state as the qubit that was initially prepared by Alice.
The implementation uses the Qiskit library to perform the quantum operations, and the statevector_simulator backend to simulate the quantum circuit.
